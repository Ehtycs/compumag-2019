# relies on NPStruct object (defined in npstruct.py) which contains a dictionary of numpy arrays and overloads certain operators abstracting the mesh and basis details (element type, integration points etc.) away from the user. 
# 
# The term inside the brackets evaluates to an NPStruct containing the integrand evaluated in integration points. Calling on method ```integrate()``` evaluates to an NPStruct object containing the local stiffness matrices of elements. Calling on ```assemble()``` uses the mesh connectivity information to assemble the global stiffness matrix as ```scipy.csr_matrix```.
