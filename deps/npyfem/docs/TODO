TODO, updated 23.2.2018


MAIN FOCUS:

Import/export module iotools.
  x api specifications
  - finish and connect gmsh_parser to iotools package
  - write vtk import/export and connect to package
  - write unit tests

Post processing tools
  - define some specifications for behaviour and data model
  - write a class which takes user defined post processing
    functions similarly as integrator
  - write unit tests

MISC:

Improve the setting of boundary conditions
  - Remove bottlenecks from Dirichlet boundary conditions
    * Basically: can the boundary conditions be taken into account
      earlier during the processing.
  - Add more general way to enforce different kinds of
    boundary conditions/integral conditions

Write unit tests
  - It would be nice to have some test coverage. Now we have almost none :D
